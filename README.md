### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am currently working for Hilab in the researchand development team. Here I am developing algorithms for augmenting the quality of microscope images and segment blood cells and platelets.

I also worked with artificial intelligence techniques for Banco do Brasilâ€™s computer vision room. I have a deep knowledge of machine learning and deep learning. I am passionate about signal processing, robotics, and mathematics. 

In my masterâ€™s degree, I used AI techniques to classify the electrical signal of the forearm. Through that moving a virtual hand prosthesis. Now, I am studying the reconstruction of signals sampled at a subNyquist frequency for amplification and compression of images and other signals.
